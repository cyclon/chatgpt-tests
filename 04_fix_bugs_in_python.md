The Python code you've provided contains several bugs. Here are the issues along with the corrected code:

## Issues in the Code
1. Module Import Error: The random module is not imported, which is required for generating random numbers.

2. Incorrect Function Call: The method pd.dataframe is incorrectly named. It should be pd.DataFrame.

3. Data Generation Logic: The way random numbers are being generated for x and y is incorrect. The random.uniform and random.normal functions are not standard functions in the Python random module and do not take a single integer as an argument. You likely intended to use numpy functions.

4. Undefined 'z' Column: You are trying to group by a column 'z' which does not exist in the dataframe.

5. Aggregation Logic: The lambda function in the aggregation is not defined correctly for computing mean values. It computes the sum of the product of x and y, which is not a standard summary statistic.

## Corrected Code
Below is the corrected code with annotations:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np  # Importing numpy for random number generation

# Assuming you want to create a DataFrame with 1000 rows
n = 1000

# Creating a DataFrame with random data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.uniform(size=n),  # Uniform distribution
    'y': np.random.normal(size=n)    # Normal distribution
})

# If you need a 'z' column for grouping, you should define it. 
# Here's an example where 'z' is randomly assigned as either 'A' or 'B'
data['z'] = np.random.choice(['A', 'B'], size=n)

# Computing the mean of 'x' and 'y' for each group in 'z'
summary_stats = data.groupby('z').agg({
    'x': 'mean',
    'y': 'mean'
})

print(summary_stats)
```

## Explanation
· Numpy for Random Numbers: I used numpy for generating random numbers as it's more suited for creating arrays of random numbers. The np.random.uniform and np.random.normal functions generate arrays of numbers from uniform and normal distributions, respectively.

· Creating a 'z' Column: Since your original code suggests grouping by a 'z' column, I added a 'z' column with random categorical values ('A' or 'B'). You might need to adjust this according to your actual data.

· Mean Calculation: The aggregation function now correctly computes the mean of x and y for each category in 'z'.
